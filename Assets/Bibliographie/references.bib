    abstract = {We have generalized the ABCD propagation law, Q2 $=$ (AQ1 $+$ B)/(CQ1 $+$ D), for an optical system by introducing a generalized complex radius of curvature Q for a general optical beam. The real part of 1/Q is related to the mean radius of curvature of the wave front, while the imaginary part is related to the second moment of the amplitude of the beam.},

    abstract={Laser-induced breakdown and damage to transparent materials has remained an active area of research for four decades. In this paper we review the basic mechanisms that lead to laser-induced breakdown and damage and present a summary of some open questions in the field. We present a method for measuring the threshold intensity required to produce breakdown and damage in the bulk, as opposed to on the surface, of the material. Using this technique, we measure the material band-gap and laser-wavelength dependence of the threshold intensity for bulk damage using femtosecond laser pulses. Based on these thresholds, we determine the relative role of different nonlinear ionization mechanisms for different laser and material parameters.}
